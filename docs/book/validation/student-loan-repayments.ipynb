    "Student loan repayments in the UK are calculated as a percentage of income above a threshold, varying by loan plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plan 1** (pre-2012 England/Wales, Scotland, NI): 9% of income above threshold\n",
    "- **Plan 2** (post-2012 England/Wales): 9% of income above threshold\n",
    "- **Plan 4** (Scotland post-2017): 9% of income above threshold\n",
    "- **Plan 5** (England post-2023): 9% of income above threshold\n",
    "- **Postgraduate**: 6% of income above threshold\n",

    "The FRS captures reported student loan repayments (`student_loan_repayments`), while PolicyEngine calculates repayments based on income and loan plan type (`student_loan_repayment`).\n",
    "\n",

    "## Analysis of discrepancies\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis reveals that **all** problem cases (people reporting repayments but with zero modelled) have incomes below the repayment threshold. The model is correctly applying the threshold logic - these people should not owe mandatory repayments based on their annual income.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why are they reporting repayments? Several factors explain this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Voluntary repayments**: People can choose to pay more than the minimum required, or make direct payments to reduce their loan balance faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Intra-year income variation**: The FRS captures annual income, but someone may have had higher-paying employment for part of the year (triggering PAYE deductions) before their income dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Self-employed direct repayments**: Self-employed individuals make direct repayments based on prior year income, which may differ from current year income.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Employment timing**: Someone starting or ending employment mid-year may have PAYE deductions based on annualised pay that differs from their actual annual income.\n",
    "\n",
    "These factors represent a fundamental limitation of annual microsimulation models - we cannot capture voluntary overpayments or intra-year income dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among those **required to pay** (income above threshold), the weighted correlation is much higher (~0.68), indicating the model works well for mandatory repayments."

    "## Known limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "### No cap at outstanding balance\n",
    "\n",
    "The model currently calculates repayments as 9% of income above threshold with no cap. For high earners, this can produce unrealistically high repayments that exceed their actual loan balance.\n",

    "Example from the data:\n",
    "- Person with \\u00a3420k income\n",
    "- Modelled repayment: \\u00a335,470\n",

    "- Explanation: They likely paid off their loan during the year\n",
    "\n",
    "### FRS `student_loans` is not outstanding balance\n",
    "\n",
    "The FRS variable `student_loans` (from `tuborr`) represents the amount borrowed THIS YEAR by current students, not total outstanding balance. This is why 98.7% of people reporting repayments have `student_loans = 0`.\n",

    "PolicyEngine UK's student loan repayment model produces aggregate totals within ~5% of reported FRS values. Key findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Value |\n",

    "| Weighted correlation (all reporters) | ~0.16 |\n",
    "\n",
    "The lower overall correlation reflects:\n",
    "1. Many FRS respondents report repayments despite having incomes below the threshold\n",
    "2. This includes voluntary repayments, intra-year income changes, and employment timing effects\n",
    "3. These factors cannot be captured in an annual microsimulation model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model correctly applies the statutory repayment formula (9% of income above threshold), but users should be aware that:\n",
    "- Individual-level repayment predictions have significant uncertainty\n",
    "- Aggregate totals are more reliable than individual predictions\n",
    "- The model does not capture voluntary overpayments\n",
    "- High earners may have overstated repayments (no cap at balance)"
