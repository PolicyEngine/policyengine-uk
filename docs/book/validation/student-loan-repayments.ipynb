    "\n",
    "The relatively low individual-level correlation suggests several factors may explain differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Timing differences**: Reported repayments reflect actual payments made during the tax year, which may include voluntary overpayments or vary based on pay frequency and employment changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Employment variation**: Someone may have had periods below or above the repayment threshold during the year, while our model assumes constant annual income.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple loan plans**: Some individuals may have both Plan 1 and Plan 2 loans, complicating the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Study status**: Current students may have different repayment patterns not fully captured in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Plan misclassification**: The loan plan imputation in the microdata may not perfectly match individuals' actual loan types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite individual-level variation, the aggregate totals are reasonably aligned, suggesting the model captures the overall scale of student loan repayments in the UK economy."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "PolicyEngine UK's student loan repayment model produces aggregate totals within a reasonable range of reported values. The individual-level correlation is lower than for income tax calculations, reflecting the complexity of student loan timing and the limitations of annual income-based calculations. For microsimulation purposes, the model provides a reasonable approximation of student loan repayment flows, while users should be aware of these limitations when analysing individual-level impacts."
