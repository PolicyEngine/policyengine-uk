    "# PolicyEngine-UK\n",
    "\n",
    "This book contains an introduction to using PolicyEngine-UK to model UK taxes and benefits. It is currently a work in progress and may be added to. PolicyEngine-UK is a microsimulation model of the UK tax and benefit system: it is a model which calculates variable values over UK entities from given policy parameters and structures. In practice, this gives it two main uses: calculating statistics under current tax and benefit law, and simulating effects of potential new changes to the legislation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're grateful to the [UKMOD](https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/research/projects/ukmod) team for publishing descriptions of their model; our ability to reference these descriptions accelerated OpenFisca UK's development. UKMOD is maintained, developed and managed by the Centre for Microsimulation and Policy Analysis at the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER), University of Essex.\n",
