    "## Program description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Tax-free childcare helps working families with childcare costs. For every **£8** paid into a childcare account, the government adds **£2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program provides financial support up to **£2,000** per year (**£500** per quarter) for each eligible child. For disabled children, this support increases to **£4,000** per year (**£1,000** per quarter).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eligibility requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Age criteria\n",
    "Standard childcare support extends until September 1st following the child's **11th** birthday. For **disabled children** who receive disability benefits or are certified as **blind/severely sight-impaired**, support continues until **September 1st** following their **16th** birthday.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Income requirements\n",
    "The program considers employment and self-employment income. The maximum adjusted net income allowed is **£100,000** per year for each partner. Minimum earnings requirements (per **3 months**) vary by age:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Age group | Minimum earnings |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **21+** | **£2,379** |\n",
    "| **18-20** | **£1,788** |\n",
    "| **Under 18/Apprentices** | **£1,331** |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Work status\n",
    "Eligible individuals must be either **employed**, **self-employed**, or on qualifying leave (**sick**, **annual**, or **shared parental leave**). Applications can be submitted if starting work within **31 days**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-working partners may still qualify if they receive any of these benefits: **incapacity benefit**, **severe disablement allowance**, **carer's allowance**, or **contribution-based employment and support allowance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional rules\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Income assessment\n",
    "The program considers:\n",
    "* Employment income\n",
    "* Self-employment income\n",
    "* **New self-employed** businesses (under **12 months**) benefit from more flexible earnings requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Program interactions\n",
    "Tax-free childcare is compatible with the **15/30 hours free childcare** program but cannot be combined with:\n",
    "* **Working tax credit**\n",
    "* **Child tax credit**\n",
    "* **Universal credit**\n",

    "In the following steps, we explain how PolicyEngine models the Tax-Free Childcare program through parameter definitions and calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Age determination\n",
    "First, we determine which children in the household are age-eligible for the program, as Tax-Free Childcare is only available until specific age thresholds.\n",
    "* `standard.yaml` and `disability.yaml` define age thresholds\n",
    "* `tax_free_childcare_child_age_eligible.py` calculates eligibility by:\n",
    "  - Checking person's age\n",
    "  - Determining disability/blind status\n",

    "  - Returns boolean indicating if age requirement is met\n",

    "After identifying eligible children, we evaluate if the parents meet the income criteria, examining both minimum and maximum thresholds.\n",
    "* `countable_sources.yaml` specifies eligible income types\n",
    "* `income_limit.yaml` sets the maximum income threshold\n",
