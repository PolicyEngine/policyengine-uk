    "\n",
    "A universal program providing free childcare for all **3-4 year olds** in England. Each eligible child receives **570 hours** of free childcare annually, typically delivered as **15 hours** per week across **38 weeks** of the year. Parents may arrange different hour distributions if their provider offers flexibility.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Parameter Definition\n",
    "Located in `parameters/gov/dfe/universal_childcare_entitlement/`, key parameters include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Program eligibility:\n",
    "  * `min_age.yaml`: Defines the minimum eligible age (3 years)\n",
    "  * `compulsory_school_age.yaml`: Sets the upper age limit\n",
    "  * `hours.yaml`: Specifies the 15 hours per week entitlement\n",
    "\n",
    "* Funding parameters:\n",
    "  * `childcare_funding_rate.yaml`: Defines the hourly funding rates\n",

    "* Geographic eligibility:\n",
    "  * Verifies residence in England using `country` variable\n",
    "  * Based on Childcare Regulations 2016 (part 33)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Age requirements:\n",
    "  * Checks child meets minimum age requirement\n",
