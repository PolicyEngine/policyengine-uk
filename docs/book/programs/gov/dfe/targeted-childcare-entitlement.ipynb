    "# Targeted childcare entitlement\n",
    "\n",
    "[Official government guidance](https://www.gov.uk/help-with-childcare-costs/free-childcare-2-year-olds) | [Legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2147/made)\n",

    "## Program description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The targeted childcare entitlement (also known as the **2-year-old offer**) provides **15 hours** of free childcare per week for eligible 2-year-old children. The entitlement totals **570 hours** annually and it delivered across **38 weeks**. This program specifically targets families who meet certain income or benefit criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eligibility requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Age criteria\n",
    "Children must be **exactly 2 years old** - not younger or older. Once a child turns 3, they transition to the universal or extended childcare entitlement programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefit-based eligibility\n",
    "Families qualify if they receive any of these benefits:\n",
    "* **Income Support**\n",
    "* **Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA)**\n",
    "* **Income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)**\n",
    "* **Pension Credit (Guarantee Credit)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Eligibility conditions\n",
    "Families may also qualify based on income thresholds if they receive:\n",
    "* **Universal Credit** with household earned income of **£15,400 or less** per year\n",
    "* **Tax Credits** (Working Tax Credit or Child Tax Credit) with household income of **£16,190 or less** per year\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Geographic scope\n",
