# The rate at which ALL workers' employment income is reduced due to the salary sacrifice cap.
# When the salary sacrifice cap is active, employers face increased NI costs on excess contributions.
# They spread these costs across ALL employees (not just affected workers), reducing everyone's pay.
#
# Calculation from blog (https://policyengine.org/uk/research/uk-salary-sacrifice-cap):
# - Total excess above £2,000 cap: £13.8 billion
# - Employer NI on excess (at 15%): £2.1 billion
# - Total UK employment income: ~£1.3 trillion
# - Broad-base haircut rate: £2.1bn / £1.3tn ≈ 0.0016 (0.16%)
#
# This is applied to ALL workers' employment income, not just salary sacrificers.
# The economic logic: employers cannot target only affected workers (who would negotiate
# to recoup the loss), so they spread the cost across all employees.
