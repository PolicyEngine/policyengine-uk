# The percentage by which employees reduce their salary sacrifice pension contributions in response to the cap.
# - 0 = no adjustment (employees keep high salary sacrifice and pay NI on excess)
# - 0.5 = employees reduce salary sacrifice by 50% of the excess above cap
# - 1.0 = employees fully optimize (reduce salary sacrifice to exactly the cap)
# Most employees would optimize their salary sacrifice to avoid NI charges by reducing it to the cap level.
