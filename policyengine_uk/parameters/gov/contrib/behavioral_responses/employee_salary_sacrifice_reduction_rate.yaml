  The percentage by which employees reduce their salary sacrifice pension contributions
  in response to the salary sacrifice pension cap.
  - 0 = no adjustment (employees keep high salary sacrifice and pay NI on excess)
  - 0.5 = employees reduce salary sacrifice by 50% of the excess above cap
  - 1.0 = employees fully optimize (reduce salary sacrifice to exactly the cap)

  Most employees would optimize their salary sacrifice to avoid NI charges by reducing
  it to the cap level. The excess returns to regular employment income.
