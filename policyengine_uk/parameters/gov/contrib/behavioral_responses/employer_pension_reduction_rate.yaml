  The percentage by which employers reduce their pension contributions in response
  to the salary sacrifice pension cap NI charge.
  - 0 = no reduction (employers absorb the cost)
  - 0.5 = employers reduce contributions by 50% of the NI charge
  - 1.0 = employers reduce contributions by 100% of the NI charge (full offset)

  Evidence suggests many employers would reduce contributions to partially or fully
  offset the 15% NI charge they face on salary sacrifice amounts above £2,000.
