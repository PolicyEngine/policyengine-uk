  Whether the salary sacrifice pension cap reform is in effect.

  When true (reform active):
  - Salary sacrifice pension contributions above £2,000 are subject to employee and employer NI
  - Employers may reduce pension contributions in response (see behavioral_responses.employer_pension_reduction_rate)

  When false (reform inactive):
  - No cap on salary sacrifice pension contributions
  - All salary sacrifice pension contributions remain exempt from NI (baseline/current law)

  This switch allows easy comparison between baseline and reform scenarios.
