description: Student loan interest rates
label: Interest rates
documentation: |
  Interest rates applied to student loan balances vary by plan type.
  Plan 2 has income-contingent rates that vary between RPI and RPI+3%.
  Plan 5 and Plans 1/4 have simpler fixed rate structures.

  Note: These parameters document the policy rules. Interest accrual
  is not currently modelled in the microsimulation as it requires
  tracking loan balances over time.
