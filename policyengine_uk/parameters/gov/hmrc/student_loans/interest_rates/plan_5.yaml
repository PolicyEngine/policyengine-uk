    Interest rate for Plan 5 student loans (from September 2023).
    Set at RPI only - no additional percentage based on income.
    This is simpler than Plan 2 which has income-contingent rates.

    The removal of the real interest rate for Plan 5 was announced in
    the February 2022 Higher Education Policy Statement.
