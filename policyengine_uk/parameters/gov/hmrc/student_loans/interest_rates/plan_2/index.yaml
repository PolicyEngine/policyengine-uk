description: Plan 2 student loan interest rates
label: Plan 2 interest rates
documentation: |
  Plan 2 student loan interest rates are income-contingent after graduation.

  While studying: RPI + 3%
  After graduating:
  - Income at or below lower threshold: RPI only
  - Income between lower and upper threshold: RPI + tapered rate (0% to 3%)
  - Income at or above upper threshold: RPI + 3%

  This progressive structure means higher earners pay more interest,
  though the actual repayment amount still depends on income, not the
  loan balance or interest rate.
