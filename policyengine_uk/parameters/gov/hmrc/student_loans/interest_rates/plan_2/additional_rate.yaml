    Maximum additional interest rate for Plan 2 student loans.
    Added to the base rate for higher earners.

    Per Regulation 21A(10), the additional interest rate is calculated as:
    3 × (I - L) / (H - L)
    where I = borrower's income, L = lower threshold, H = higher threshold.

    The actual additional rate is tapered between the lower and upper
    income thresholds, from 0% at the lower threshold to this maximum
    at the upper threshold.

    For income at or above the upper threshold, the total rate is:
    base_rate + additional_rate (i.e., RPI + 3%)

values:
  2012-09-01: 0.03  # 3%
