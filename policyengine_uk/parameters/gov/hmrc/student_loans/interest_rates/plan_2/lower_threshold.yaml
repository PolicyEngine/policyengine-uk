    Lower income threshold for Plan 2 interest rate tapering (L in the formula).
    Below this income, borrowers pay the base rate (RPI) only.
    Above this, the additional rate begins to taper in.

    Per Regulation 21A(10), this is the "lower interest threshold".
    Note: This is the same as the Plan 2 repayment threshold.
