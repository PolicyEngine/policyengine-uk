# Tests for Scottish Child Payment Premium for under-ones
#
# POLICY: Children under 1 receive FIXED £40/week TOTAL payment (from April 2026)
#         Children 1+ receive standard SCP rate (£27.15 in 2025, inflates thereafter)

#
# This is NOT a fixed bonus - it's a fixed total amount.
# As standard rate inflates, the effective "premium" decreases to maintain £40 total.
#
# 2026 calculations:
# - Standard SCP: £27.15/week * 52 = £1,411.80/year
# - Premium for under-1s: £40/week * 52 = £2,080/year (TOTAL, not base + bonus)

# Test 1: Scottish family with 1 baby (age 0) - BEFORE premium (2025)
- name: Scottish family with 1 baby - before premium (2025)
