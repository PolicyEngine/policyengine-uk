- bump: patch
  changes:
    fixed:
      - Fixed Scottish Child Payment baby bonus reform to use Person-level variable structure, matching the refactored base variable. The reform now correctly uses parameterized baby bonus rates instead of hardcoded values.
      - Fixed SCP baby bonus effective date to 2027-04-01 (fiscal year 2027-28) per Scottish Budget 2026-27.
