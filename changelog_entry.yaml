      - Refactor reforms to use two-layer pattern with bypass parameter, matching PolicyEngine US architecture. All gov.contrib parameter references have been removed from gov/ variables - contrib parameters now only affect behavior via reforms. This enables programmatic reform application and cleaner separation between core law (gov/) and policy proposals (contrib/).
