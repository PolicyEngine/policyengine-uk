  changes:
    fixed:
    - Scottish top rate (48%) threshold corrected from £125,140 to £112,570 (above
      personal allowance). The threshold was incorrectly stored as the total income
      value instead of the amount above PA, causing the top rate to effectively start
      at £137,710 instead of £125,140.
