- bump: minor
  changes:
    added:
      - Added gift_aid_grossed_up variable that computes Gift Aid grossed up by basic rate per ITA 2007 s.58.
      - Added comprehensive Gift Aid tests covering basic rate relief, higher rate relief, and PA taper interaction.
    fixed:
      - Fixed Personal Allowance taper calculation to deduct grossed-up Gift Aid from ANI per ITA 2007 s.58. Previously, Gift Aid donations did not reduce ANI for PA taper purposes, causing high earners (GBP 100k-125k) to receive less tax relief than legally entitled.
    changed:
      - Added legislation references (legislation.gov.uk) to gift_aid and personal_allowance variables.
